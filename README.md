## Description

Research has proven that solar panels that can move either on single or double axis solar panels can generate up to 40% more electricity when compared to
stationary solar panels. Although there are many working dual-axis solar panels, meaning they can tilt in any direction so that they are always pointed directly at the sun, 
there is a need to make a small, feasible solution to take to potential future colonies on Mars and the Moon. Introducing, DynamicPanel, equipped with one photoresistor, that is 
compact, feasible, and even has the option to upgrade to up to four photoresistors for maximum efficiency. DynamicPanel is prototyped with an Arduino UNO microcontroller and all 
wiring is through a breadboard but if a custom circuit board was made with just the necessary components along with soldering, our device can be made _even_ smaller and lighter.
The servo motors in this device are connected directly to each other, reducing the weight which is crucial to transport this to future colonies. DynamicPanel, paving the future 
of energy.
